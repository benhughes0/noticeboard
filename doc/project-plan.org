Analysis

- Noticeboard can be accessed by different users across a network
- A string of text (a message) can be posted, read, replied to and removed
- Can read the whole board, or a specific message and only its replies
- Every message has an ID
- Anonymous
    - No sign in
- No need to specify host
    - Must be another way of specifying a host
    - eg. environment variable, config file

Policy

- Maximum n POSTS at once across the noticeboard
- Quota per person?
- which messages can you reply to? all? only top level?
- No tracking

Issues
Using “ “ for text input
Using # for ID, shell comment sign

Questions
Should we be able to specify a host? (eg —host=)
