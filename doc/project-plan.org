** Goals

*** Documentation
**** Logbook
- what we are doing day by day
- just a few short notes and links to any interesting commits will do
  nicely
- we can keep those in same format then merge
  - e.g. a convention to use in an email

  - not every detail - major architecural stuff
    - why are we building it this way
- good comments in code
- message sequence diagrams
- API docs
**** User documentation
***** How to install

**** DONE Plan
CLOSED: [2021-03-19 Fri 17:21]
- [-] plan
  - [X] add project-plan.org to ./doc directory
  - [X] agree goals about what we're making
  - [ ] plan
    - [ ] write noticeboard server
    - [ ] write noticeboard client
    - [ ] implement according to decisions around functionality
    - [ ] document it
    - [ ] deploy it
    - [ ] use it
  - [ ] timeline & division of labour, etc.

***** outputs
- [X] repo
- [X] analysis
- [X] plan

*** Week 3
[2021-03-26 Fri 14:00]

- work on specification
  - 'black box' functionality
  - background work for Sean
  - complete spec together
  - external interfaces
  - APIs

- coming up with detailed implementation plan
  - how it all works
  - what programs, what they do, how they work, how they interact

**** outputs
- [X] specification
  - [X] message sequence diagrams
  - [X] functional spec for server
  - [X] functional spec for client
  - [X] API spec
    - tooling for specifying APIs?
- [X] timeline of deliverables/products
- [X] implementation plan
  - what needs to be built
  - who is going to build what
- [X] first version of client/server (based on echo client/server)

*** Week 4
[2021-04-01 Thu 15:00]

- working version of noticeboard
  - so at least Ben & Sean can use

nb

: C:\> nb.py post Hi everyone!

$ nb.py post Hi everyone!
$ nb.py read
$ nb.py read 352
$ nb.py reply 352 text
$ nb.py remove 352

$ nb.py reply 352 text

subcommand = reply
id = arg 1
text = rest of args joined by space

**** TODO Sean convert to JSON messages
- NB. you have to use
  : conn.send(json.dumps(msg).encode('utf-8'))
ie. you have encode the message as utf-8 even though JSON is defined
as mandating utf-8 for data interchange.

See https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-8.1

#+begin_quote
JSON text exchanged between systems that are not part of a closed
ecosystem MUST be encoded using UTF-8 [RFC3629].
#+end_quote

So, python, WTF?

**** DONE Ben figure out how to use argparse to implement subcommands
CLOSED: [2021-04-09 Fri 14:13]

**** outputs
- [X] working version

***** Sean
- [X] add POST
- [X] add READALL

- start new thread after worker crashes

***** Ben
- [X] add READ #id
- [X] add REMOVE #id
- [X] add REPLY #id

*** Week 5
[2021-04-09 Fri 14:00]

- finish off noticeboard client and server
- with subcommands

- delete associated REPLIES entries when deleting from MESSAGE

- docker build -t soha/server01 -f ./Dockerfile .
- docker run -p12345:12345 -it --rm soha/server01 ./test-noticeboard.sh

**** outputs
- [ ] finished client/server with subcommands

*** Week 6
[2021-04-16 Fri 14:00]

- deploy shared noticeboard service
  - accessible to anyone in IRFS
    - eg. via Slack

**** outputs
- [ ] shared noticeboard service
  - need to decide this how to deliver final output
  - maybe rely on slackbot for sharing
  - possible config
    - /internal/ noticeboard
    - /API/ slackbot can talk to /internal/ and /internet/
    - /internet/ slack can talk to /API/ slackbot

*** Week 7

REMOVE #352

** Analysis
- Noticeboard can be accessed by different users across a network
- A string of text (a message) can be posted, read, replied to and removed
- Can read the whole board, or a specific message and only its replies
- Every message has an ID
- Anonymous
    - No sign in
- No need to specify host
    - Must be another way of specifying a host
    - eg. environment variable, config file
** Policy
- Maximum n POSTS at once across the noticeboard
- Quota per person?
- which messages can you reply to? all? only top level?
- Anonymous
  - No tracking
- Anyone can remove a message (subject to feedback)
  - but be polite
** Issues
- Using "" for text input
- Using # for ID, shell comment sign
- Anyone can remove any message by id - is this an issue?
  - Want to preserve the anonymity and no tracking
  - We cd give people two ids - a public id (which you can reply to)
    and a private token (which can be used to remove the message)
** Questions
- Should we be able to specify a host? (eg =—host=)
